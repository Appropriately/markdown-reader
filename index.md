# Markdown Reader

##### _Another_ way of displaying markdown in a web browser!

## About

I really wanted to start writing my notes with markdown, but I also wanted a really nice and convenient way of accessing them. This led me to build this, so the only person I can blame if I don't like it is myself.

## Links

Here are a couple of files that might be worth checking out:

* [The project's README](javascript:renderReadme();)

* For seeing all that Showdown JS can do, there is a [test page!](javascript:loadMarkdownFromFile('markdown/testpage.md');)
